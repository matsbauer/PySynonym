Added the function of inserting the searched word into the returned list - so when searching for the word lamp and having the word lamp in the sentence, returnal is positive.

Version 0.0.5 the readme-pypi.rst file had to be removed, as it caused an error in the installation process.
Version 0.0.6 needs to be uploaded to pip in order to work
Version 0.0.7 the urllib2 package needed to be removed from setup.py and the returnal feature for the keyword has been added
